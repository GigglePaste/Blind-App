# Blind-App
The project as a whole was not succesful to be run on an android phone even though PADDLEOCR was fast enough. ONNX, TFlite and executorch were all used but satisfactory results were not attained.
Buildozer was used to convert the python application to a android application. This was succesful but the app was prone to crashing. 
A simple webapp based alternative was also done, but the main aim of the project of making it offline would have to be changed, hence, it was removed.
Finally a desktop application was also done, but you can't lug a computer with you.

**The current files in this repo are the 0.1v of the project, hence the use of pytesseract and lack of apk or scripts that were used. There were around 6-8 complete upheaval of the code done after this from the ground up.**
